## Project description

Classic game tic-tac-toe built with React.

## Run the project
To test the project you need to have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.
1. Start server locally `npm start`
2. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the project in your browser


## Todo
- Add *draw* as a game state
- How to display if game is over(either someone won or a draw)

## Ideas
- Once game functionality is completed - think of adding a different color scheme or font. Although black and white seems to work well too for such a classic.


## Stack
- React
- HTML & CSS
