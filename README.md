## Project description
Classic game tic-tac-toe, which you can play with other users on the browser. 

This is my first project made with React. After reading the documentation I knew it was time to put the theory to the side and go practical. I chose tic-tac-toe because the game itself is simple which means I can focus more on React.

### Features
Besides having main functionalities of the game, you also can:
- Restart the game
- See what tiles other player hovers

## Run the project

The project is deployed with Render at: https://tic-tac-toe-38ac.onrender.com/.

You also have the option to test it locally. Below are the steps required to run the project on your computer.

You need to have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.
1. Start backend server by navigating to `backend` folder and running `npm start`
2. Start frontend server by navigating to `frontend` folder and running `npm start`
3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the project in your browser

After you've done the previous steps you now need to simulate two players in your computer. You can do so by opening two different browsers(ex: Opera, Chrome, Firefox) or you can have just two incognito windows of the same browser.
