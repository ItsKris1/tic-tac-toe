## Project description

Classic game tic-tac-toe built with React.

## Run the project
To test the project you need to have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.

2. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the project in your browser


## Todo
- Add *draw* as a game state
- Consistent layout

## Ideas
- Once game functionality is completed - think of adding a different color scheme or font. Although black and white seems to work well too for such a classic.
- Add the option to choose player names and their game buttons
- Make the game multiplayer(local at first then maybe public)

## Stack
- React
- HTML & CSS
