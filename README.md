## Project description
Classic 2-player game tic-tac-toe, which you can play locally on two different browsers. 

You need to have two players to play and both players have the option to reset the current game. 
## Run the project
To test the project you need to have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.
1. Start backend server by navigating to `backend` folder and running `npm start`
2. Start frontend server by navigating to `frontend` folder and running `npm start`
3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the project in your browser

After you've done the previous steps you now need to simulate two players in your computer. You can do so by opening two different browsers(ex: Opera, Chrome, Firefox) or you can have just two incognito windows of the same browser.
